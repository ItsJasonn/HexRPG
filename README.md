# HexRPG

HexRPG is now fully open-source. All users are allowed to go to the GitHub link (located on the resource page, or it can be found on the Discord server.

I allow anyone to use the code and change it, but not to publish it. Keep it for yourself. If I find out someone changed the code and published it anywhere or shared it in any way I have the right to sue you for stealing valuable code.

Good luck coding (and fixing the remaining bugs)!
